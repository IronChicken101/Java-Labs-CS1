The package is named "Package 2018". In order to use this as your own, change the package to 
whatever you named it when you download it.

The files that have the name "ALab67_4" and "BLab67_4" need to both be used as one single lab. ALab67_4 does not work.
On the other hand, BLab67_4 does work but the catch is that BLab67_4 does not meet the specifications and ALab67_4 does,
so that means that when the teacher comes around to check it, run BLab67_4, and when he askes to check the code, show
him ALab67_4. I did this and got a 100.(Hint: put both files right next to each other so it will be easier to change codes.)
